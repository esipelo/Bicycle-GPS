# Bicycle-GPS

Here you can find the programmation code for a Bike GPS connected by bluetooth to your smartphone. 

To upload the libray, click on the file "Adafruit_NeoPixel-master.zip" and after click on "View raw". To include this library in Arduino, once the file upload, in the toolbar, go on "Sketch/Include Library/Add .ZIP Library.." and choose "Adafruit_NeoPixel-master.zip".

The .stl files are the files for the packaging made with a 3D printer. Copy-of-garmin-mount-v2.stl is to fix the packaging on the bicycle handlebar,  Garmin_Quarter_turn_Plate.stl allows to fix the packaging on the handlebar piece, pièces_haute.stl is the top of the packaging and pièces_basse is the bottom of the packaging

Velo.grl is the file to create a plexiglass, with a CharlyRobot, to protect the LEDs but it is possible to make it with a 3D printer, you just have to create the file.
